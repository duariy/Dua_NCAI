# 🧠 Neuroimaging Practice Repository
Note: This repository is part of an extension of the AI Leadership Training Program offered by NeuroCogniAI (https://nc-ai.ca/). It is designed to help trainees and learners gain practical experience working with neuroimaging data using open-source tools.

This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in working with neuroimaging data, particularly structural MRI scans in NIfTI format. It includes everything you need to get started, from datasets to runnable Jupyter notebooks and a complete requirements.txt file for setting up your environment.

🔍 What’s Included:

🗂️ A curated collection of practice-ready NIfTI MRI scans, sourced from reputable open-access datasets.

📓 Jupyter notebooks demonstrating:

-How to load .nii or .nii.gz files

-Visualize brain volumes across axial, sagittal, and coronal planes

-Extract individual slices from any orientation

-Save selected or full sets of slices as .jpg or .png images

-Speed up processing using parallelization

📦 A requirements.txt file listing all necessary Python packages (e.g., nibabel, numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, etc.) for a complete neuroimaging toolkit.

This repo is ideal for students, researchers, and developers who want to explore medical imaging workflows, learn how to manipulate MRI data, or prepare datasets for machine learning and computer vision projects.
